	<h3>Course Description:</h3>
	
Claims about what is necessary and what is possible are central to philosophical discourse. The development of modal logic in the 20th century has given philosophers an important tool for investigating crucial questions regarding modality. What makes a claim to neccesity true? What does it mean to say that something has a necessary property (or essence)? Are there mere possibilties? Can the natural sciences be understood as investigating the nature of things? We will be investigating some of these questions.

 <h3>The Writing Assignments</h3>

 <h4>The short written responses.</h4>
 <p>The short written responses serve two purposes:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Prepare you for in-class discussion.</li>
  <li>One crucial skill to succeed in academia is the ability to extract a sharply defined point from a larger piece. The short responses are designed to hone this skill. To this end the reading response should be no longer than 500 words and consist of two parts. The <b>first part</b> is a quick precis of an argument from the reading. This might focus on a single piece (article, book section) or a part of a piece. The precis can also take up an issue or argument discussed in multiple pieces. In any case, you should extract and present concisely the main line of argument that you are interested in. Be as specific as possible and pinpoint the line of argument that you are commenting on. Do <em>not</em> summarize the whole article. The <b>second part</b> should be your critical thoughts on the argument that you extracted in the first part of the reading response: maybe you have an objection to the argument; or you think some elaboration is helpful to clarify the issues; perhaps you think there is a hidden premise that the author fails to mention; etc.</li>
 </ul>
  <h4>The final paper.</h4>
  <p>
  Ideally, your final paper should be the product of a relatively long period of work and thought, so start thinking about it early. The topic should be closely related to some issue discussed in the course. You will present your main point of the paper during the last week of class.</p>
  



<h4>How to submit assignments.</h4>
 <p>Please submit all material through the assigment section of Canvas. Please use either of the following file formats: MS Word doc/docx, LibreOffice/OpenOffice odt. (These make commenting easy and any halfway decent word processing software is capable of saving in either of these formats.)</p>

 <h3>A note on professional ethics</h3>
 <p>The work you do in this course must be your own. Feel free to build on, react to, criticize, and analyze the ideas of others but, when you do, make it known whose ideas you are working with. You must explicitly acknowledge when your work builds on someone else's ideas, including ideas of classmates, professors, and authors you read.  If you ever have questions about drawing the line between others' work and your own, ask the course professor who will give you clear guidance. </p>
